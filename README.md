## Hi, I'm Manas Kar!

* I am interested in PDE.

## Problem Solving Sessions

* A series of Problem Solving Sessions will be organized at IISER Bhopal.
  * The aim is to develop an interest for mathematics among the students, through encouraging them to work on problems, falling broadly within the scope of Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The first session will tentatively take place in August, 2024.
  * For more information, you may visit [this page](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/).
